### Takeaway's from the project
This project was extremely difficult for me and I wouldn't have been able to finish it without the help of other students. This last week was a rough week for me and I felt like almost everything we had learned made 0 sense. After throwing all of this together with help from others, I feel like this assignment put together all the pieces I was missing. While I'm still nowhere near where I should be with this material, I believe I now have enough knowledge to be able to work through something like this assignment again, but on my own.
